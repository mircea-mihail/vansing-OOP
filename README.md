# vansing-OOP

This repository's code simulates a rudimentary class inheritence from the base class vans to the two inherited classes, clothes and shoes. For the << operator to word, the vans class also inherets an IOStream class. In the outlet class different object types are stored using shared pointers and upcasting, and printed with downcasting. The menu class provides a terminal interface between the user and the programme and the exceptions file helps address some of the exceptions within the project.

Below there is a unified modeling language (UML) diagram in order to help better visualise the code.
